Testing receiver performance.

Normal Burst Testing

Multipath, single image, r28 code

For raw BER, a bit error is defined as a bit that has the wrong value
and a confidence of > 10%.

sum(abs(bref .- dm) > 0.55)/148

Audio starts to fail at raw BER > 6%.

3 symbols of delay is 11 microseconds and about 3.3 km.

reference (no image):
delay	BER		chan peak/mean
0		0		13.7 (22.7 dB)

Channel models from GSM 05.05 Appendix C.
These are 3-tap approximations to the test cases in the spec.
In all cases the first tap is 0 delay, 0 dB and implied.
At 8x sampling, on delay step is 0.5 us.

Access Burst Testing
Demod performance appears to be the same as for the normal burst.
Checked TOA compensation up to 63 symbol periods.
