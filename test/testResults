Testing receiver performance.

Normal Burst Testing

Multipath, single image, r28 code

For raw BER, a bit error is defined as a bit that has the wrong value
and a confidence of > 10%.

sum(abs(bref .- dm) > 0.55)/148

Audio starts to fail at raw BER > 6%.

3 symbols of delay is 11 microseconds and about 3.3 km.

reference (no image):
delay	BER		chan peak/mean
0		0		13.7 (22.7 dB)

0-deg, 0 dB image:
delay	BER		chan peak/mean
0.5		0		11.2 (21.0 dB)

1.5		2.7		7.0 (16.9 dB)

Access Burst Testing
Demod performance appears to be the same as for the normal burst.
Checked TOA compensation up to 63 symbol periods.
